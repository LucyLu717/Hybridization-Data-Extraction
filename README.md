# Hybridization-Data-Extraction
Java program used to extract data from "Handbook of Avian Hybrids of the World"

This is a project I initiated and completed when I was helping two researchers build bird hybridization database at Cornell Lab of Ornithology.

The purpose of the program is to automatically process data from "Handbook of Avian Hybrids of the World" and write out the extracted data in the desired form. This program extracts hybridization data for over 2600 species in a few seconds and saves researchers a dramatic amount of time.
